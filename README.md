# Derivative Free Optimization Benchmarking
This paper examines the rank one update of the CMA-ES algorithm and compares its performance using the noiseless suite of the BBOB (Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking) benchmark using the COCO platform. The maximum number of function evaluations per run is set to $10^5$ times the dimension of the search space, with the default population size, 30 restarts and no increasing population. And $10^4$ for a large population size of 300 and 30 restarts, and the population was increased by a factor of 2 after each restart. The algorithm did very well with low population, but on the other hand it had a bad performance with high population expect for $ùëì_5$ all of the instance, target pairs were completely solved for all dimensions.
